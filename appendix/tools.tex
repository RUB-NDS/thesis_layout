\emph{This is an example of how to declare the AI tools used, if any.}

In the preparation of this thesis, several AI tools were utilized to enhance the research and writing process.
I hereby declare that I have carefully checked all the suggestions generated by AI for correctness.
The following tools were particularly instrumental:

\begin{description}
    \item[ChatGPT] Used for brainstorming research questions and to rephrase texts to improve readability. It was not used for crafting text bodies.
    \item[Grammarly] Employed for proofreading and enhancing the overall writing quality.
    \item[DeepL] Applied for translating key passages from German sources into English.
    \item[DALL-E] Leveraged to create conceptual illustrations. \emph{Personally, we do not think that it makses sense to include AI-generated images in a thesis.}
\end{description}
