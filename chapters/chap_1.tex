\section{Related Work}

In the introductory section, provide a concise yet informative summary of the most significant previous works related to this thesis. Mention two to four research papers that bear close resemblance in terms of objectives or methodological approach. These references will serve as valuable context for the reader and help establish the relevance of your study within its respective field.

\section{Contribution}

When writing the Introduction section of your thesis, it is important to include a contributions subsection where you can directly state the key results and contributions of your work. Unlike a novel or thriller, your thesis is not meant to keep the reader in suspense. It is important to declare your results and key contributions directly in the introduction.

One common mistake is to hide the interesting parts of your work in the introduction, hoping to build suspense and keep the reader engaged. This is not necessary in academic writing. Instead, you should clearly state your key results and contributions so that readers can understand the significance of your work right from the start.

The contributions subsection should provide a clear and concise summary of what you have achieved in your research. You should highlight the new knowledge or insights that your work has contributed to the field, as well as any practical applications or implications. This is an opportunity to convince readers that your work is important and worth their time.

Remember that the contributions subsection should not be overly technical or detailed. Its purpose is to provide a high-level overview of your work and its significance, not to get into the nitty-gritty of your research methods or results. Keep your writing clear and concise, focusing on the key contributions that your work has made to the field.
